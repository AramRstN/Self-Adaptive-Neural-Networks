# Self-Adaptive-Neural-Networks

*Abstract*

In the rapidly evolving field of deep learning, the deployment of complex models, particularly for computer vision tasks, presents a formidable challenge when considering the constraints of edge computing environments. This paper explores the development and implementation of self-adaptable neural networks to address the challenges of deploying complex deep learning models in edge computing environments. Focusing on the constraints posed by limited computational resources, privacy, and real-time processing needs, the study proposes a methodology for dynamically adjusting neural network architectures, particularly through channel pruning, to meet the changing requirements of various execution venues without significantly compromising accuracy.
